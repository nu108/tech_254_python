What are libraries and module? 
Module is a single file. While libraries are a collection of modules.

What is the purpose of module and libraries?

Modules allow you to break down your code into smaller, more manageable pieces.

Libraries simplify development by offering pre-built solutions to common problems, enabling developers 
to leverage existing code rather than reinventing the wheel.

For example: 
import random

rand_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

print(random.choice(rand_list))

Why are libraries and modules useful?

- Code reusibility 
- Effciency 
- Scalablity 

List the most important base(in-built) libraries and modules in Python.
What do they do/what are they used for?

1) "math"- contains mathematical functions 
2) "random"- Generates random numbers and performs random selections.
3) datetime:Provides classes for working with dates and times,
including formatting and arithmetic operations.
4) "time":Provides access to system time and date functions.
Useful for timing and benchmarking code.
