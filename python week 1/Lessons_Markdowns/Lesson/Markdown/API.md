What are APIâ€™s? 

Application Programming Interfaces, are sets of rules and
protocols that allow different software applications or 
systems to communicate and interact with each other.

They define the methods and data formats that applications 
can use to request and exchange information, 
enabling seamless integration and interaction between
diverse software components.

How are they used and why are they so popular?
Integration: APIs are used to integrate various services, systems, 
and software components. For example, a weather application
can use a weather data API to fetch real-time weather 
information.

Data Access: APIs provide access to data from databases, 
web services, and third-party platforms. Social media platforms
, for instance, offer APIs for developers to access user data
and perform actions.

Automation: APIs enable automation by allowing scripts and programs
to communicate with other software. For example, 
a CI/CD pipeline can use APIs to trigger automated deployments.

Extensibility: APIs allow third-party developers to extend the
functionality of a software product. Plugins and extension
often rely on APIs to interact with a host application.

Reusability: APIs promote code reuse. Developers can leverage existing APIs 
to access services and data, saving time and effort.

Scalability: APIs facilitate the development of scalable applications by allowing
components to interact independently. This is essential in modern, 
distributed systems.

What is a rest API?

is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with
web services or web-based software applications. 

What makes an API restful?

Stateless, Client-server artchitechture, uniform interface, 
Resources, statelessness on a server

HTTP Methods: RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform actions on resources. 
The common HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs are:

GET: Retrieve data from the server.

POST: Create a new resource on the server.

PUT: Update an existing resource or create it if it doesn't exist.

DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.

What is HTTP? (what does it stand for and what is it used for? What is HTTPS?)

Hypertext Transfer Protocol

HTTP- serves as the communication protocol that allows web clients (typically web browsers) to request resources
(such as web pages, images, videos, and other files) from web servers.
It defines how these requests and responses should be structured and how
web servers and browsers should interact.

Key functions & uses of HTTPS:

-Requesting Web pages 
-Transmitting data 
-Finding resources 
-Status code 


HTTPS is commonly used for secure online transactions, login pages,
and any situation where the privacy and integrity of data are essential.

Verb- specifies the action the client wants to perform on the resource identified
by the URL

URL-The URL provides the address for locating the resource on the web.

Version- The HTTP version indicates which version of the HTTP protocol the client is 
using to make the request.

Header & Key value pairs- A header is a part of an HTTP request or response message that provides metadata about the message or the data being transmitted.
Headers are key-value pairs consisting of a header name and a corresponding value

In HTTP headers, key-value pairs are commonly used to convey
information about the message or the data it contains.

Body- The body of an HTTP request or response contains the actual data being 
transmitted between the client and server.

Text- The body of an HTTP request or response contains the actual data being 
transmitted between the client and server.

JSON

XML

what is statelessness? 
it means that the server does not store any information about the client's previous requests or sessions between requests.

aching is a technique used in computing and data storage to store and retrieve data in a faster and more efficient manner.
